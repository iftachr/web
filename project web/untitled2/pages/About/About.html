        Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other
        electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a
        light-sensitive material such as photographic film.
        <br/> It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as
        its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.

        The camera is the image-forming device, and a photographic plate, photographic film or a silicon electronic
        image sensor is the capture medium.
        <br/>
        The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.

        Photographers control the camera and lens to "expose" the light recording material to the required
        amount of light to form a "latent image" (on plate or film) or RAW file (in digital cameras) which,
        after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image.
        <br/>
        Digital cameras use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as
        charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.

        <br/>
        The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.
        <br/>
        The camera (or 'camera obscura') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light
        is
        excluded except the light that forms the image.
        <br/>
        It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however,
        must be illuminated.
        <br/>
        Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be
        photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated.
        <br/>
        This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used.
        <br/>
        As soon as photographic materials became "fast" (sensitive) enough for taking candid or
        surreptitious
        pictures, small "detective" cameras were made, some actually disguised as a book or handbag or
        pocket
        watch (the Ticka camera) or even worn hidden behind an Ascot necktie with a tie pin that was really
        the
        lens.
        <br/>
        The movie camera is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on
        recording medium.
        <br/>
        In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a
        series of images, each called a "frame".
        <br/>
        This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie
        projector at a specific speed, called the "frame rate" (number of frames per second).
        <br/>
        While viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of
        motion.
        <br/>
